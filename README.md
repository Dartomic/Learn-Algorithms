### Other

[Advanced data structures and algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/gaoji-shuju-jiegou/)  University Professor, Ming Zhang, is on the Coursera course at Peking University. At the end of the course, you will master:
*Multi-dimensional array usage
*Generalized tables
*Trie trees
*AVL trees
*Extension trees, and other advanced data structures combined with the sorting, internal sorting, retrieval, and index-related algorithms. These are for to efficiently solve the real life problems, and apply them to solve more complex problems as well. Of course, there are also many other algorithms in the Coursera video course.

[Design and Analysis of Algorithms](https://class.coursera.org/algorithms-001/lecture)
Wanling Qu, a professor at Peking University, teaches an algorithmic course in Coursera. Firstly, it introduces some basic knowledge about algorithm, then expounds the classical algorithm design idea and analysis technology, mainly involves the algorithm design technology: divide and conquer strategy, dynamic programming, greedy method, backtracking and branch gauge, etc. Each video is equipped with a handout (PDF file) to read and review.
